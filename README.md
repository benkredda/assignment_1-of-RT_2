# assignment_1-of-RT_2

## Explanation of the assignment work :
this assignment is a composition of three small assignments that are : 


✓ Properly comment using sphinx the 2nd RT1 – assignment
✓ Create a jupyter notebook to interact with the simulation of the 2nd assignment
✓ Perform a statistical analysis on the first assignment, considering two different implementations (yours, and a
solution of one of your colleagues) and testing which one performs better, when silver and golden tokens are
randomly placed in the environment.
As performance evaluators you may possibly consider:
- the average time required to finish the task
- the number of success / failures
- …


❑ It’s very important here to clearly define what is the hypothesis that you want to test. Do you want to test which
algorithm does perform better when the token are placed on the two circles? Or when the token are randomly
placed in the environment?
- Based on the hypothesis, you need to design the experiments accordingly
Carefully plan the number of experiments and choose a suitable statistical approach. 


❑ Write a report composed of:
- Hypotheses made (null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis)
- Description and motivation of the experimental setup (types of experiments, number of repetitions)
- Results
- Discussion of the results with statistical analysis
- Conclusion (is the hypothesis proven?) 

## Guide to solutions :
### 1- Guide to the first assignmnent of Sphinx documentation :please use this link to get access to my repository where i provided the sphinx documentation .

[link to my repository with the sphinx documentation](https://github.com/benkredda/assignment_2) .

Once you click on the link there will appear my second assignment repository done in RT1 , you will need then to move to the Sphinx branch (and not the main branch, you can select the branch from the right top of the repository where main is chosen by default). in the sphinx i provided a folder called docs with the documentation of the three nodes. and in the Readme file of that repository i provided the link to the html page.Again i provided the link to my documentation here      

#### For the documentation please click here :

### 2- Guide to the second assignment of jupyter notebook : please use this link to get access to my repository where i provided the jupyter notebook .

[link to my repository with the jupyter notebook](https://github.com/benkredda/assignment_2) .
once you click on the link , my repository of the second assignment of RT1 will appear with a file named jupyter-Node-a.ipynb   leading to my jupyter notebook.

### 3- Guide to the third assignment of the statistical report : please use this link to get access to my repository where i provided the statistical report .

the statistical report is in a pdf named statistical report .
