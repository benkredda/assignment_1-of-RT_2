# assignment_1-of-RT_2

## Explanation of the assignment work :
this assignment is a composition of three small assignments that are : 


✓ Properly comment using sphinx the 2nd RT1 – assignment
✓ Create a jupyter notebook to interact with the simulation of the 2nd assignment
✓ Perform a statistical analysis on the first assignment, considering two different implementations (yours, and a
solution of one of your colleagues) and testing which one performs better, when silver and golden tokens are
randomly placed in the environment.
As performance evaluators you may possibly consider:
- the average time required to finish the task
- the number of success / failures
- …


❑ It’s very important here to clearly define what is the hypothesis that you want to test. Do you want to test which
algorithm does perform better when the token are placed on the two circles? Or when the token are randomly
placed in the environment?
- Based on the hypothesis, you need to design the experiments accordingly
Carefully plan the number of experiments and choose a suitable statistical approach. 


❑ Write a report composed of:
- Hypotheses made (null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis)
- Description and motivation of the experimental setup (types of experiments, number of repetitions)
- Results
- Discussion of the results with statistical analysis
- Conclusion (is the hypothesis proven?)
